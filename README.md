# Roselyn and Elwin's library

A library app created with Python/Django

## Exercises
1. Getting Started
   - [ ] Create a Django project with one app, 'library'
   - [ ] Add views and templates for a home and books show page (`/` and `/books/<id>`)
   - [ ] The home page will list all the book titles
   - [ ] The show page will list the chosen book title and author
   - [ ] Show a custom 404 if book is not found
   - [ ] Use dummy data for now:
```python
[
    { 'id': 1, 'title': 'Life, the Universe and Everything', 'author': 'Douglas Adams'},
    { 'id': 2, 'title': 'The Meaning of Liff' 'author': 'Douglas Adams'},
    { 'id': 3, 'title': 'The No. 1 Ladies\' Detective Agency' 'author': 'Alexander McCall Smith'}
]
```

2. Add database and models
   - [ ] Setup a 'library' database (your choice of db) 
   - [ ] Create models for Book and Author
     - [ ] Authors have a name
     - [ ] Books have a title and a Foreign Key for author
   - [ ] Make and run migrations
   - [ ] Add your models to your admin dashboard and create some records in the GUI
   - [ ] Update your views to take data from the database instead of the dummy data list

3. Add User authentication
   - [ ] Create register, login and logout routes
   - [ ] Use the UserCreationForm to complete your templates
   - [ ] Register some new users via your registration form
   - [ ] Make the book show route only available to logged in users
   - [ ] Add a new field of 'borrower' to the Book model as a Foreign Key to User
   - [ ] In your admin dashboard, assign some books a borrower
   - [ ] Update your book show template to show if it is available to loan or not
  
4. Add UI forms
   - [ ] Create a new book form accessible at `books/new`
   - [ ] On success, the form redirects to the new book's show page
   - [ ] Create a button on the book show page
   - [ ] If the book is available, on clicking the button, the current User becomes the borrower of that book
   - [ ] If the book is on loan by another User, current User sees disabled button
   - [ ] If the book is on loan by the current User, on clicking the button, the book is returned
